// site rendering the 404 page in production: it stripped trailing slashes
// (turning the root path '/' into '') and then compared against the base,
// so — with base '/' — isKnownPath was false for every URL, including the
// homepage. The hash router (#/projects, #/articles, ...) handles all
// navigation client-side, so every path should render the app.
