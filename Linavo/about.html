        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Linavo was created with a simple goal: to redefine what Discord bot hosting can be.
            Developers deserve more than the bare minimum — they deserve tools that empower them,
            insights that guide them, and a platform that works with them, not against them.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section fade-in">
        <h2>Why Linavo Exists</h2>
        <p>
            Most hosting platforms offer the same basic experience: a container, a console, and a restart button.
            But Discord bot developers face unique challenges — unpredictable resource usage, dependency issues,
            rate limits, crashes, and deployment headaches. Linavo was built to solve these problems at the source.
        </p>
        <p>
            From smart throttling to deep analytics, from GitHub integration to built‑in API endpoints,
            Linavo gives developers the tools they’ve always needed but never had.
